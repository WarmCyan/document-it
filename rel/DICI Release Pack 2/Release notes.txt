DICI 2.0.0 Release Notes
Date: 6/2/2016
----------------------------

IMPORTANT NEW FEATURES:
- Project-level sections! In the .apiproj file, you can specify sections, and files below delimiter all are associated under the same section
- Project-level sidebar is now generated on all pages. It lists all sections, and for each section it will list classes and interfaces associated with it
- A file can now contain multiple classes/interfaces and the engine will handle them appropriately

KNOWN BUGS:
- Files without classes or interfaces still crash the program. The base functionality for documenting raw files that just have functions exists, so this crash will be fixed in a later release.
